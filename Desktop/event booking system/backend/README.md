This backend is built to support an Event Booking System, using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It handles all the server-side operations, like letting users register, log in, view events, and book tickets. It also allows admin users to manage events and users. The backend makes sure the app runs smoothly and safely by checking permissions and protecting user data.

The code is organized into folders for clarity. The models folder contains MongoDB schemas for Users, Events, and Bookings, defining what information is stored and how it is structured. The controllers folder has the main logic for handling requests and responding to the frontend. The routes folder connects URL paths to the controllers, like /api/auth for authentication, /api/events for event actions, and /api/bookings for booking tickets. There is also a middleware folder that contains checks for authentication and admin access, making sure users can only do what they are allowed to. Lastly, the utils folder has helper functions, such as generating secure JWT tokens for login sessions.

To keep sensitive information safe, the backend uses a .env file where you store the MongoDB connection string (MONGO_URI), the server port (PORT), and the JWT secret (JWT_SECRET). Passwords are encrypted before saving to the database, and JWT tokens are required to access protected routes. This ensures that usersâ€™ information is never exposed and only authorized users can make changes.

To start the backend, first install all dependencies with npm install. Then run the server using node server.js. The server will start at http://localhost:5000, and you can test all routes using Postman. You can register new users, log in, create events, book tickets, or view bookings. Admin users have extra controls to manage all users and events. The backend is designed to be simple, clear, and ready to scale, so anyone can understand it or extend it for more features.
